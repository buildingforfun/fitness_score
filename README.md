# Fitness Score

What problem is this solving?
---------------------------------------
Many people struggle to accurately assess their own fitness levels compared to others in their age group. This is because fitness can be a complex concept, making it challenging for individuals to objectively evaluate their overall health and physical condition relative to their peers.


What am I building?
---------------------------------------

I'm building a tool that provides users with a single, comprehensive fitness score based on a range of general fitness metrics. This score will serve as a standardized reference point, allowing users to easily compare their fitness level to others and track their progress over time.
